Hey there, I'm Theodoros (Theodore) Vasiloudis and I'm a Machine Learning researcher at the Swedish Institute for Computer Science
in Stockholm. My main research interests include large-scale machine learning, graph processing, and
natural language processing. I also contribute to the [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org) distributed processing engine,
and am one of the core developers of its Machine Learning library, [FlinkML](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/libs/ml/).

I completed my Master's Degree in Machine Learning at the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH.
My thesis work was performed at Spotify AB, under the supervision of Hedvig Kjellstr√∂m, KTH and
Boxun Zhang, Spotify. My work centered on context-aware recommendation systems, and investigating
how do contextual variables such as time affect user choice. You can read my thesis [here](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:754842/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

I am a graduate of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, school of Computer Science. During my
studies I followed the Software Engineering track and focused on Machine Learning and Data Science
courses which lead to a thesis on the subject of multi-label classification using Bayes networks,
working with the Machine Learning and Knowledge
Discovery group of the school, under the supervision of Dr. Grigorios Tsoumakas.

In addition to my studies I was an active member of the student organisation Board of
European Students of Technology (BEST) which has helped me gain experience in working in a
multicultural environment, being in contact with company and state representatives, and managing a
team of people from diverse backgrounds and organising local and international events.
